SWIG Python Distributions
=========================

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/swig.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/swig)

A project that packages SWIG as a Python package, enabling `swig` to be installed from PyPI:

```sh
pip install swig
```

or used as part of `build-system.requires` in a pyproject.toml file:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["swig"]
```

PyPI package versions will follow the `major.minor.patch` version numbers of SWIG releases.

Binary wheels for Windows, macOS, and Linux for most CPU architectures supported on PyPI are provided. ARM wheels for Raspberry Pi available at https://www.piwheels.org/project/swig/.

[SWIG License](https://github.com/swig/swig/blob/master/LICENSE): GPL-3.0-or-later with portions under [LICENSE-UNIVERSITIES](https://github.com/nightlark/swig-pypi/blob/main/LICENSE-UNIVERSITIES) (see [LICENSE-SWIG](https://github.com/nightlark/swig-pypi/blob/main/LICENSE-SWIG) for details)

Installing SWIG
===============

SWIG can be installed by pip with:

```sh
pip install swig
```

or:

```sh
python -m pip install swig
```

Building from the source dist package requires internet access in order to download a copy of the SWIG source code.

Using with pipx
===============

Using `pipx run swig <args>` will run SWIG without any install step, as long as the machine has pipx installed (which includes GitHub Actions runners).

Using with pyproject.toml
=========================

SWIG can be added to the `build-system.requires` key in a pyproject.toml file for building Python extensions that use SWIG to generate bindings.

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["swig"]
```
